commit 
after done with your operation or completed one project feature completely u can do commit 
git commit -m "msg u want to print"

after that u can use 
git log 
which basically tells u about who and when changes had been made 

to clear 
clear

if u want to add all the file ito tracking basically stagging use .operator which means all 
git add.

when u do the checkout operation u alloted to the initial page 
git checkout "id"       

the delted file u want to regain u can used
git checkout master

checkout is used to move from one branch to another brach

to know which brach i am currenyly know 
git branch
there was only one commit inside th initial 

dev branch is the brach which is dereived from the main or master branch  
dev=development

git branch dev#this is used to define new branch 

to jump to this branch we have to jump on it 
checkout->is used to move on to te next 

to make new branch with the file name
git checkout -b kishore/binaryMinMax

u cannot keep the same name of the file in different branches 
say if u have the repository master and one is the dev inside that repository i have created dev in that i modify the code and tried to save the modified file in the feature brach command had excuted but it is not showing while press the get status command but that file is not visible so from that i concluded that same name file cannot be there 

here we come with the important topic called merf


always up to date


to not allow to vies anybody we use .gitignore
create dot ignore file 

file which u dont want to track put it inside dot ignore file 

                                clear intentin 

                                purpose 

                                success
